My Thoughts on the code
(*) The structure of the code is OK. It uses the repository pattern, which is a good practice for separating the data access logic from the business logic. However, there are some opportunities for improvement.
(*) Code can be refactored into separate methods or even separate classes to follow the Single Responsibility Principle and make the code more maintainable.
(*) Eloquent ORM is used in the code to simplify your queries, making them more readable and easier to maintain. Have margin of improvements. Many places have raw queries which is not suggested.
(*) Add comments and docstrings to the methods to help other developers understand their purpose.
(*) Can Use Validators for handling input validation in Laravel. It helps to ensure data quality and consistency, improve the user experience, prevent security vulnerabilities, and reduce code complexity.

Analysis of the provided code.

1) Formatting and Structure:
The code formatting is generally consistent, with proper indentation and spacing. However, it could be improved by following the PSR-2 coding style guide for PHP more closely, such as using 4 spaces for indentation instead of tabs.

2) Logic and Readability:
(*) The code could benefit from more comments explaining the logic of various operations. The existing docstrings should also be improved to include more details and follow the phpDocumentor format.
(*) Variable naming can be improved for better readability. For instance, using more descriptive variable names such as $normalJobs instead of $noramlJobs, and $currentUser instead of $cuser. And writing them in camel case such as $jobItem instead of $jobitem.
(*) The getUsersJobs and getUsersJobsHistory methods contain very similar logic for handling customers and translators. This can be refactored into separate methods or even separate classes to follow the Single Responsibility Principle and make the code more maintainable.

3) Code Quality and Maintainability:
(*) There are hard-coded values like '15' for pagination, which should be replaced with constants or configuration values, making the code more flexible.
(*) The use of arrays like $emergencyJobs and $normalJobs makes the code harder to maintain. Consider using value objects or custom classes to represent the data and its operations.
(*) Instead of using if-else statements, consider using a switch-case to handle different user types. This would make it easier to add new user types in the future and improve code readability.
(*) Can do simpler queries such as the use of pluck and all methods for collections can be simplified to just using the get method.
(*) The current implementation of the code uses raw SQL queries at many places to interact with the database. It's better to use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, such as Doctrine or Eloquent, to make it easier to interact with the database and handle the mapping between the database tables and the PHP objects. such as DB::table('users')->whereIn('email', $requestdata['customer_email'])->get();
(*) The current implementation of the code doesn't use transactions when inserting or updating bookings. This can lead to inconsistent data if an error occurs during the insertion or updating process. It's better to use transactions to ensure that either all the operations are successful, or none of them are.
(*) The current implementation of the code doesn't handle exceptions properly. Instead of catching exceptions and logging them, the code simply returns false, which doesn't provide enough information about the error that occurred. It's better to catch exceptions and throw more meaningful exceptions or use a logger to log the exceptions properly.
(*) The current implementation of the code doesn't validate user input data. So DB is vulnerable to false data, exceptions and even security risks.

4) Dependencies and Coupling:
(*) The class is tightly coupled to the User, Job, and other models. Consider using Dependency Injection to inject these models or repositories into the class, making the class more testable and maintainable, such as instead if using User model directly can add UserRepository to find users.

How I would have done it:
(*) I have refactored the code to show how I would have done it. I didn't re-factored the whole code, I only changed few of the functions to give and idea about my thoughts. Here are few points that I think could have been better.
(*) Improve variable naming and add more comments for better readability.
(*) Refactor the code to follow the Single Responsibility Principle and the Open/Closed Principle.
(*) Replace hard-coded values with constants or configuration values.
(*) Use Dependency Injection to reduce coupling and improve testability.
(*) Use Eloquent ORM instead of raw queries or better to have them in repository and use that.
(*) Use Transactions while inserting and updating to have consistent data in case of errors.
(*) Handle exceptions properly to get better insight of what went wrong.
(*) Validate user input data to avoid any run time error as well as in-valid data in DB.

UNIT TEST
(*) I have added two different test for mentioned functions. One by API call and one by directly calling function from Class.
